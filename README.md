# Advanced Data Architectures for Business Intelligence: Multi-source IMDB Movie Data Integration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing advanced data architectures for business intelligence by integrating movie-related data from multiple sources: MySQL, TSV files, and JSON files. Using tools such as Alteryx, Talend, Power BI, and Tableau, we profile, analyze, and visualize data to create a comprehensive business intelligence solution.

## Key Components

1. **Data Architecture**: Designed a robust architecture to support data integration and analytics, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
2. **Dimensional Data Modeling**: Implemented a Movie Titles Dimension table as a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) to track historical changes over time.
3. **Data Integration and ETL (Extract, Transform & Load)**: Utilized Alteryx and Talend for data extraction, transformation, and loading processes from MySQL, TSV, and JSON sources.
4. **Data Engineering & Data Preparation**: Conducted thorough data profiling and preparation to ensure data quality and integrity.
5. **BI & Data Analytics Design**: Created and published dynamic dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, utilizing SQL scripts to enhance data visualization and reporting.
